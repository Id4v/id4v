## Hello there 👋

I'm [Id4v](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/david-rimbault) PHP Developer  @[S-Kréa](https://s-krea.fr/)

I'm curious, I like to learn, understand and create. 🤔

As I'm not really good with a pencil, code is my way of creating 🧑‍💻

I cut my teeth on vanilla PHP and nowadays I mainly do Symfony (started on 1.4 ... time flies). 🐘

While I'm mainly a backend developper, I'm trying to learn frontend techs 🧑‍🎨

If you want to contact me head to my [LinkedIn](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/david-rimbault) or to [S-Kréa](https://s-krea.fr)
